          Welcome to the Machine Learning Toolkit and Showcase. Click
          on the dashboards or examples below to explore the kinds of
          analytics this app enables. Each dashboard includes both
          end-to-end examples with datasets we have provided, as well
          as the ability to apply the dashboard to your own data. You
          can inspect the dashboard panels and other code to see how
          each one works and then create custom dashboards to suit
          your needs. Everything you see was implemented on the Splunk
          platform using public interfaces, so you can
          bring similar functionality to your own organization's
          Splunk instance; there's nothing hidden up our sleeves.
