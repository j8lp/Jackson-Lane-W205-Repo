Question:Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals? 

Methology: Take the variances of scores for each type of measure.

Data:
measurename	variance
ED1	8,617.740839212507
ED2	3,864.6924460743544
OP 18	1,656.5529409803205
Median Time to Transfer to Another Facility for Acute Coronary Intervention	869.0306968514053
Thrombolytic Therapy	481.98665882944397
Head CT results	477.18888614639235
Fibrinolytic Therapy Received Within 30 Minutes Of Hospital Arrival	352.6666666666667
Fibrinolytic Therapy Received Within 30 Minutes of ED Arrival	325.74632352941165
Median time to pain med	314.0819735739413

Conclusion: I'm not sure what ED1 and ED2 are, but they have huge variances.
Note how all the measures are from the effective_care table and not the readmissions table.  That's probably because the measures from readmissions looks exclusively at ratio data.  It's probably not fair to compare the variance of something like "Median Time to Transfer to Another Facility," which has no upper bound, to something like "Death Rates for CACB," which will be at most 100.
